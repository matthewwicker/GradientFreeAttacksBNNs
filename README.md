# Gradient-Free Adversarial Attacks on Bayesian Neural Networks (AABI 2021)

This is the code repository for the paper 'Gradient-Free Attacks on Bayesian Neural Networks' that was accepted to Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference 2021. The preliminary and rough framework that is used for inference on DNN architectures has been updated and is 'maintained' in a rough since at github.com/matthewwicker/deepbayes for issues regarding the framework please contact matthew (dot) wicker (at) cs.ox.ac.uk
